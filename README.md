## UI approach
I created SVG images from the text using [iconomy](https://run.iconomy.app/). The prompt said to use "single-select" and "multi-select." I wasn't clear if this meant to implement dropdowns as might be inferred from that terminology. If I had to implement that I would look into using a UI component library such as [prime react](https://primereact.org/multiselect/) for that. However I felt that firstly a toggle would be better instead of a single select in the case of the first question as there are only two options. However, I felt that it would be even better to have icons that the use can click on instead of different options as this would be a better user experience. I am also assuming that the user can't select both `other` and another work type.
